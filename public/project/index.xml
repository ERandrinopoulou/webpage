      <description>&lt;p&gt;Active collaboration with Dr. Rhonda Szczesniak, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati, Division of Biostatistics &amp;amp; Epidemiology, Cincinnati Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, United States and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate analytic approaches to assess changes in FEV1 decline. We focus on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Natural progression of lung function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2a Lung function progression before and after treatment (ivacaftor) initiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2b Between treated and untreated groups of subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Variability in lung function decline before and after treatment (ivacaftor) initiation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unveiling the Impact of Social and Environmental Determinants of Health on Lung Function Decline in Cystic Fibrosis through Data Integration using the US Registry</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Active collaboration with Dr. Rhonda Szczesniak, Division of Biostatistics &amp;amp; Epidemiology, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating different data resources provides a more comprehensive overview of patient information that could improve healthcare decision-making. In Cystic Fibrosis (CF), which is a genetic disorder affecting the lungs, biomarkers that track lung function decline serve as important predictors for assessing disease progression. Previous studies have shown that incorporating location-specific social and environmental determinants significantly improves the accuracy of disease progression prognostication. To explore the variability in rapid lung function decline among people with CF lung disease, we integrate patient registry data from the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation with social and environmental health information. We focus on the relation between lung function and the community deprivation index. Our proposed methodology, an extension of multivariate mixed-effects models, models multiple longitudinal outcomes and incorporates varied functional forms to establish their connections. By examining different time periods, we investigate whether this relationship varies based on patients&amp;rsquo; exposure duration to areas with a high deprivation index. We explore this relationship within each state of the US. A strong association is observed between lung function and the area under the deprivation index curve across all states. Incorporating environmental and socioeconomic markers in clinical decision-making strategies can provide more insights into the progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Personalised dynamic prediction of the recovery profile of upper limb capacity within stroke services</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Active collaboration with Dr. Ruud Selles, Department of Rehabilitation Medicine and Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Hand Surgery in Erasmus MC and Dr. Harm Slijper, medical performance officer of Equipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays stroke is a leading cause of adult disability. Several measures are used in rehabilitation medicine to assess the performance of the patients. Our ultimate goal is to implement individualized dynamic predictions of those measure in Gemstracker which is a software package consisting of different patient information collected during clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different type of information is available at each visit such as patients characteristics, upper extremity function but also some other activity measurements. Physicians want to utilize all available data to predict performance measurements six months after stroke. Nowadays, predictions are based on simplistic approaches, such as regression, that ignore the dynamic nature of the disease. A popular framework to analyze repeated measures is the mixed-effects models. We aim to provide dynamic predictions by extending the standard mixed-effects model to account for the special features of the data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We focus on how to quantify and evaluate those predictions by investigating different proper scoring rules. To evaluate those predictions we use an internal validation procedure, simulations and external data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactive interfaces are created so that the treated physician can obtain dynamic predictions (&lt;a href=&#34;https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/DynamicPredictionARATapp/&#34;&gt;https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/DynamicPredictionARATapp/&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/LongitudinalMixtureModelFMUE/&#34;&gt;https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/LongitudinalMixtureModelFMUE/&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/Dynamic_Predictions_Bartel_Index/)&#34;&gt;https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/Dynamic_Predictions_Bartel_Index/)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
