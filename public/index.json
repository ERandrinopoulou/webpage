This information includes multiple longitudinal measurements, and sometimes, also survival outcomes. The motivation comes from several clinical applications. In particular, patients after a heart valve replacement have a higher risk of dying or requiring a reoperation. These patients are followed echocardiographically, where several biomarkers are collected. Another example comes from patients after stroke, where measurements to assess recovery are taken over time.\n\nEach outcome of interest is mainly analyzed separately, although it is biologically relevant to study them together. Previous work has focused on investigating the association between longitudinal and survival outcomes; however, less work has been done to examine the association between multiple longitudinal outcomes. In that case, it is common to assume a multivariate normal distribution for the corresponding random effects. This approach, nevertheless, will not measure the strength of association between the outcomes. Including longitudinal outcomes, as time-dependent covariates, in the model of interest would allow us to investigate the strength of the association between different outcomes.\n\nSeveral challenges arise in both the analysis of multiple longitudinal data and longitudinal-survival data. In particular, different characteristics of the patients' longitudinal profiles could influence the outcome(s) of interest. Using extensions of multivariate mixed-effects models and joint models of longitudinal and survival outcomes, we investigate how different features (underlying value, slope, area under the curve) of the longitudinal predictors are associated with the primary outcome(s).

We investigated the impact of different statistical models and real-world scenarios on results and conclusions regarding rate-of-decline. The sample included individuals with CF aged \u003e6 years in the CF Foundation Patient Registry (2003-2016). Marginal, mixed-effects and joint longitudinal-survival models for estimating rate-of-FEV1 decline were implemented under scenarios that mimic attributes of different available types of data varied by sample size, duration and frequency of follow-up. We assessed the impact of linear and nonlinear trajectories and different correlation structures. Overall, all models indicated an approximately linear rate of decline until age 30 (-1.4% predicted/year) with minimal difference between marginal and mixed models; nonlinear models fit better than linear models. Joint models suggested more severe FEV1 decline over time. Mixed model estimates had more variability between scenarios than marginal models. Duration of follow-up was the only scenario that impacted estimates. Rate of FEV1 decline was associated with mortality across scenarios (estimated hazard ratio, HR and 95% CI for death/lung transplant, HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.66-0.68). Choosing an appropriate modeling strategy depends on the research question and data structure. Longer follow-up is best characterized with nonlinear terms.

This information includes multiple longitudinal measurements, and sometimes, also survival outcomes. The motivation comes from several clinical applications. In particular, patients after a heart valve replacement have a higher risk of dying or requiring a reoperation. These patients are followed echocardiographically, where several biomarkers are collected. Another example comes from patients after stroke, where measurements to assess recovery are taken over time.\n\nEach outcome of interest is mainly analyzed separately, although it is biologically relevant to study them together. Previous work has focused on investigating the association between longitudinal and survival outcomes; however, less work has been done to examine the association between multiple longitudinal outcomes. In that case, it is common to assume a multivariate normal distribution for the corresponding random effects. This approach, nevertheless, will not measure the strength of association between the outcomes. Including longitudinal outcomes, as time-dependent covariates, in the model of interest would allow us to investigate the strength of the association between different outcomes.\n\nSeveral challenges arise in both the analysis of multiple longitudinal data and longitudinal-survival data. In particular, different characteristics of the patients' longitudinal profiles could influence the outcome(s) of interest. Using extensions of multivariate mixed-effects models and joint models of longitudinal and survival outcomes, we investigate how different features (underlying value, slope, area under the curve) of the longitudinal predictors are associated with the primary outcome(s).\n\nWe obtain a strong association between death/reoperation with the underlying value and rate of change of the aortic valve gradient (difference in pressure on each side of the valve).

However, fitting Bayesian joint models to large datasets, such as patient registries, can require extended computing times. To speed up sampling, we divided a patient registry dataset into subsamples, analyzed them in parallel, and combined the resulting Markov chain Monte Carlo draws into a consensus distribu- tion. We used a simulation study to investigate how different consensus strategies perform with joint models. In particular, we compared grouping all draws together with using equal- and precision-weighted averages. We considered scenarios reflecting different sample sizes, numbers of data splits, and processor characteris- tics. Parallelization of the sampling process substantially decreased the time required to run the model. We found that the weighted-average consensus distributions for large sample sizes were nearly identical to the target posterior distribution. The proposed algorithm has been made available in an R package for joint mod- els, JMbayes2. This work was motivated by the clinical interest in investigating the association between ppFEV1, a commonly measured marker of lung function, and the risk of lung transplant or death, using data from the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (35,153 individuals with 372,366 years of cumu- lative follow-up). Splitting the registry into five subsamples resulted in an 85% decrease in computing time, from 9.22 to 1.39 hours.

Nevertheless, addressing complex survival data structures, especially handling both recurrent and competing event times within a single model, remains a challenge. This causes important information to be disregarded. Moreover, existing frameworks rely on a Gaussian distribution for continuous markers, which may be unsuitable for bounded biomarkers, resulting in biased estimates of associations. To address these limitations, we propose a Bayesian shared-parameter joint model that simultaneously accommodates multiple (possibly bounded) longitudinal markers, a recurrent event process, and competing risks. We use the beta distribution to model responses bounded within any interval (a, b) without sacrificing the interpretability of the association. The model offers various forms of association, discontinuous risk intervals, and both gap and calendar timescales. A simulation study shows that it outperforms simpler joint models. We analyze the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry to study the associations between lung function decline, cumulative changes in body mass index, and the risk of recurrent pulmonary exacerbations, while accounting for the competing risks of death and lung transplantation. Our efficient implementation allows fast fitting of the model despite its complexity and the large sample size. Our comprehensive approach provides new insights into cystic fibrosis progression.

The data include longitudinally measured responses (e.g., biomarkers), and the time until an event of interest occurs (e.g., death, intervention). In many epidemiologic studies, these outcomes are separately analysed, although it may be of public health interest to study their association while including key exposures. To that end, it is desirable to employ methods that examine the associations of exposures with longitudinal measurement outcomes simultaneously. This method is referred in the statistical literature as joint modelling of longitudinal and survival data. The idea behind joint modelling of longitudinal and survival data is usually to couple linear mixed effects models for longitudinal measurement outcomes and Cox models for censored survival outcomes. Recent extensions of these models motivated by real-life applications, including shrinkage approaches, time-varying effects and latent classes, will be presented.  Furthermore, subject-specific dynamic risk predictions based on the joint modelling framework will be illustrated.","tags":null,"title":"Assessing Risk Indicators in Clinical Practice with Joint Models of Longitudinal and Time-to-Event Data","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531353600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531353600,"objectID":"e212fd29595cce2910aebc2b9db5817a","permalink":"https://www.erandrinopoulou.com/talk/lc-mixed-model-uveitis/","publishdate":"2018-07-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/lc-mixed-model-uveitis/","section":"talk","summary":"Uveitis is the inflammation (INF) of the uveal tract, i.e. the inner eye, and leads to reduction of visual acuity (VA). In contrast to other eye diseases that affect mostly elderly patients, uveitis affects young patients. Therefore, it is the leading cause of legal blindness in the working age population in the western world. Physicians utilize different types of information to predict patient VA outcome. This includes longitudinal data, such as INF, complication (COM) and other patients characteristics.\n\nA popular framework to analyze outcomes measured over time is the multivariate mixed-effects model. We aim to obtain individualized dynamic predictions of VA using all available patient information and accounting for the special features of the data set. In particular, the first challenge is to take into account that patients can be categorized in sub-groups that exhibit different progression rates for high, blind and moderate VA. Furthermore, the longitudinal outcomes can be connected 1) via random effects and 2) via association parameters between them.  A characteristic of longitudinal data, such as INF and COM, is that several features of these variables could be associated with VA (underlying value, slope, area under the curve). This could lead to a large number of parameters that need to be estimated. Therefore, the second challenge is to identify an appropriate set of predictors for the outcome of interest VA.\n\nWe propose a latent class multivariate mixed model to identify different sub-groups of patients and we compare two popular approaches that deal with variable/model selection: 1) a Bayesian shrinkage approach, where both INF and COM are included in the VA prediction model, and 2) Bayesian model averaging where INF and COM are included separately in the VA model. The two approaches are compared using a cross-validation procedure for model evaluation. Prediction accuracy is deemed acceptable when the difference between the predicted and the observed value is considered to have a non-detectable visual change for the patients. The motivation comes from a study of 365 uveitis patients with a mean age of 44. These patients visited the Rotterdam Eye Hospital in the period from 2000 to 2014.","tags":null,"title":"Dynamic Predictions of Visual Acuity in Uveitis","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Eleni-Rosalina Andrinopoulou","Paul H.
