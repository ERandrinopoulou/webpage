abstract: "FEV1 % predicted is commonly used to monitor lung function decline in Cystic Fibrosis patients. However, little work is done on whether environmental/community factors would influence the FEV1 % predictive progression. The association between the biomarker FEV1 % predicted and the geomarker deprivation index is investigated per US state. Both the biomarker and geomarker are repeatedly measured, therefore we investigated different functional forms for their association."
