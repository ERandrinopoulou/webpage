abstract: "
Joint models for longitudinal and survival data have become a popular framework for studying
the association between repeatedly measured biomarkers and clinical events. Nevertheless,
addressing complex data structures remains a challenge. In particular, even though many
applications consist of recurrent and competing event times, those are commonly not analysed
using a single model. Moreover, existing frameworks rely mainly on a Gaussian distribution for
continuous markers, which may be unsuitable for bounded biomarkers, resulting in biased
estimates of associations. To address these limitations, we propose a Bayesian shared parameter joint model that simultaneously accommodates multiple (possibly bounded) longitudinal markers, a recurrent event process, and competing risks. We use the beta
distribution to model responses bounded within any interval without sacrificing the
interpretability of the association. The model offers various forms of association, discontinuous
risk intervals, and both gap and calendar timescales. We analyse the US Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation Patient Registry to study the associations between changes in lung function and
body mass index, and the risk of recurrent pulmonary exacerbations, while accounting for the
competing risks of death and lung transplantation. Our comprehensive approach provides new
insights into cystic fibrosis progression.
