Active collaboration with Dr. Rhonda Szczesniak, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati, Division of Biostatistics & Epidemiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, United States and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

To evaluate analytic approaches to assess changes in FEV1 decline. We focus on:

1) Natural progression of lung function.

2a) Lung function progression before and after treatment (ivacaftor) initiation.

2b) Between treated and untreated groups of subjects. 

3) Variability in lung function decline before and after treatment (ivacaftor) initiation.
