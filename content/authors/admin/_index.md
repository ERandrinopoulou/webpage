I am currently the **Statistics & Mathematical Modelling Director at GSK**, where I focus on statistical methodology and its application in disease strategy.
\
\
Previously, I was an **Assistant Professor in Biostatistics at Erasmus MC**, where I taught fundamental statistical methods, provided statistical consulting to clinical collaborators, and developed innovative methodologies for analyzing complex data.
\
\
My research centers on developing **cutting-edge statistical methods** to dynamically predict and analyze large-scale data by integrating diverse sources, including environmental factors, community characteristics, imaging, and registry data, to generate novel insights.
\
\
I am passionate about bridging the gap between statistics and healthcare innovation, and I welcome opportunities for collaboration.
